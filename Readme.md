I am attempting to the Exceeds Expectations.

I decided to use the npm modules json-2-csv and cheerios to complete the task.  I additionaly used fs.

Cheerios has not been updated within the last 6 months but otherwise fits the requirments

**Reflections**
The code still feels clunky but it works.  This is my first exposure with asyn and I 
would like to learn more about promises in the future.  During testing, I was not able to catch ReferenceErrors within my try/catch.  I am still not sure why.. ex: Calling a variable that had not been declared.
